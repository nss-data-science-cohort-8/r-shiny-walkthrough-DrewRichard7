# R Shiny Walkthrough


### Guided Portion
**Day 1:**
1. Create a new Shiny project - using the multiple file format.
2. Create a new script and save as global.R in the same folder as ui.R and server.R.
3. Move the library imports into the global.R file.
4. Convert the histogram to a ggplot one.
5. Change datasets to the one from penguins.csv, making the histogram show the distribution of body mass. Update the app title and plot labels.
6. Make the plot depend on the island chosen.
7. Allow an "All" choice.

**Day 2:**
1. Add a new plot - a bar chart showing the counts by species.
2. Put these plots into columns so that they are on the same row.
3. Add a data table at the bottom to show the data selected.
4. Allow the user to select a different variable to show on the histogram.
5. Deploy the app to shinyapps.io.


### Solo Portion
Select a dataset that was used on a past project, exercise, or warmup. Build a basic Shiny app using that dataset. We'll do a show and tell at the beginning of class on Saturday.
